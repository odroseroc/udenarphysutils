The main feaure in this script is the class ExperimentalValue, that stores experimental values as a tuple containing its measurand and its uncertainty. Basic arithmetic operations can be performed on them using infix operators.

The script also includes the implementation of the functions evsin and evcos to calculate the sine and cosine of an ExperimentalValue.
